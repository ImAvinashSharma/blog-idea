## SSH into the server

```bash
    ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-x-y-z-w...amazonaws.com
```

### Enter into sudo mode

```bash
    sudo su -
```

by doing this you Enter in to root@ip-[ip]

## Install snapd

- this helps you to have a snap of your build and the projects/software that are on the server/system

## Ensure that your version of snapd is up to date

```bash
    sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
```

## Install Certbot

```bash
    sudo snap install --classic certbot
```

## Prepare the Certbot command

```bash
    sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

## Choose how you'd like to run Certbot

### Either get and install your certificates...

Run this command to get a certificate and have Certbot edit your Nginx configuration automatically to serve it, turning on HTTPS access in a single step.

```bash
    sudo certbot --nginx
```

### Or, just get a certificate

If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your Nginx configuration by hand, run this command.

```bash
    sudo certbot certonly --nginx
```
